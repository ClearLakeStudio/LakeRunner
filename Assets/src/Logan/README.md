    - copyright (4):
        - The sprite for the BrainBlastBar was taken from Super Mario World for the SNES.
        - How does it violate copyright?
        - What did I have to do to integrate it with my code?
        - What are the legal implications if you market your code with the re-used portion?
        - Fair use argument for being legally allowed to use the sprite:
            - Fair use says that you must modify 20% of a work in order to claim it is being used fairly.
            The original sprite has 418 colored pixels. I changed 152 pixels (approximately 36%) to qualify.

    - patterns (6):
        - Singleton: ItemManager (only one can exist at a time)
        - Builder/decorator/template/facade
