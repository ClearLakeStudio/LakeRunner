## Feature Overveiw
### (Feature not yet implemented)
My feature will include both Hero and Enemy NPC animations and behavior for Lake Runner.
The runner hero will have to run, jump, wall-jump, turn, encounter enemies, encounter platforms, pick up items,
and have damage, death, and victory animations, among other actions.

The enemy NPCs include crabs crocodiles, and coconuts, which must interact with the runner and the environment in various ways.
