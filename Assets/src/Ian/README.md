    <h1>Ian King - Infinite Runner/Level Generation</h1>
    <h2>Overview of Feature</h2>
    <p>The Infinite Runner mode of Lake Runner will allow players to participate in a single, continually generated level with no end. This level will feature random terrain chunks, items, and enemies, allowing for a new and refreshing experience on each run. Terrain generation must be controlled so that no incompatible terrain chunks are placed next to each other, items will be spawned randomly with preference given to more common items, and enemies will be placed in areas that allow for normal functions to take place. Each of these limiting factors will create a level of control on the development side within the random nature of the Infinite Runner mode.</p>
