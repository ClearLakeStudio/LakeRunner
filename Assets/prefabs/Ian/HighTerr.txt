Prefab: High Terr
Purpose: Taller terrain piece
Interaction: Player walks on top of it

How it works:
 - Uses a Sprite Renderer to show the high terrain of a given color.
 - Uses a box collider with boundaries set to the edges of the sprite.
 - Uses Terrain Behavior script, which:
	- Tracks the position of the object tagged "Hero" within the scene.
	- Destroys the terrain object if the Hero reaches a point 40 spaces to the right of the terrain.
