Prefab: Chunk Manager
Purpose: Handles chunk spawning and chunk interactions, primarily for Infinite Runner mode.
Interaction: Manages the world that the player sees and interacts with.

How it works:
 - Uses LoadLevel script
 - Takes boolean indicator for whether the level should be infinite or not
 - For finite, LoadLevel:
	- Spawns items at specific locations based on the current level.
	- Provides CreateRandomChunk() method, which allows for random chunk spawning within a certain radius of the hero.
 - For infinite, LoadLevel:
	- Creates ten flat platforms to help the player get started.
	- Finds and stores a terrain pool placed in the scene.
	- Randomly selects a type (flat, high, stair) and color (green, sand, stone) of terrain.
	- Places this new terrain behind the last-placed piece of terrain.
		- May also forgo spawning a piece of terrain and create an empty space.
	- Spawns items on the new terrain at random.
