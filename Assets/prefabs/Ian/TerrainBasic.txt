Prefab: Terrain Basic
Purpose: Basic, low-level terrain
Interaction: Player runs on top

How it works:
 - Uses a Sprite Renderer to show the basic terrain of a given color.
 - Uses a box collider with boundaries set to the edges of the sprite.
 - Uses Terrain Behavior script, which:
	- Tracks the position of the object tagged "Hero" within the scene.
	- Destroys the terrain object if the Hero reaches a point 40 spaces to the right of the terrain.
