Prefab: Demo Manager
Purpose: Runs a demo mode on the current level.
Interaction: No player interaction; navigates the world automatically.

How it works:
 - Runs the attached DemoController script, so just drag and drop the prefab into your overworld scene!
 - DemoController:
	- Finds the OverworldManager script.
	- Persists between scene loads so that it can be accessed from within a demo.
	- Counts from 0 to 10; when 10 is reached, the demo starts on the current level.
		- Any user input interrupts this countdown.
		- Any user input exits the demo.
	- Loads the current level and runs the demo on that level.
	- Finds the Hero object and tracks its location.
	- Creates a Demo Facade, which uses platform and chunk creation functions from separate classes.
		- These classes are Platform and ChunkGroup, respectively.
		- Demo Facade is a singleton, so only one instance of it can exist at any given time.
		- ChunkGroup is also a singleton.
	- Finds the next vertical or horizontal gap between chunks and builds platforms to move the hero between them.
		- This is done at random, so a gap may not be filled to show a level failure.
