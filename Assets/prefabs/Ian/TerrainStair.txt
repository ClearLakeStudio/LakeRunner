Prefab: Terrain Stair
Purpose: Incline or decline in terrain
Interaction: Player runs on top of it

How it works:
 - Uses a Sprite Renderer to show the stair terrain of a given color.
 - Since the stairs are at an angle, a separate prefab called "TerrStairCollider" must be attached to provide collision.
 - Uses Terrain Behavior script, which:
	- Tracks the position of the object tagged "Hero" within the scene.
	- Destroys the terrain object if the Hero reaches a point 40 spaces to the right of the terrain.
