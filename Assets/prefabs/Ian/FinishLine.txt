Prefab: Finish Line
Purpose: Signal the completion of a level
Interaction: Activates the end screen once the player passes it.

How it works:
 - Is not visible on its own, must have a separate sprite attached.
 - Utilizes the LevelFinish script.
 - LevelFinish:
	- Accesses the current platform manager and a datastore of completed levels.
	- Finds the gameOver screen object in the current scene.
 	- Raycasts directly upward and directly downward, and on collision with an object tagged "Hero":
		- Deactivates platform creation.
		- Activates the gameOver screen and sets its finishGame attribute to "true".
		- Calls the levelDatastore function FinishLevel to show that the player has completed the current level.
 	- Contains the function CanPlacePlatforms to return private data member "platforms".
