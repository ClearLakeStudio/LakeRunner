##PATTERNS_AND_DYNAMIC_INHERITANCE_DESCRIPTIONS
#Singleton
	I used the singleton pattern in the Preview.cs file.
	Only one preview platform at a time needs to exist, so instead of deleting,
	and re-instantiating each frame the mouse is held, I use a singleton to just adjust 	the preview's position and dimensions as needed.
#Decorator
	I use the decorator pattern in the BaseDecorator.cs, Platform.cs, Floating.cs, 	Falling.cs, and Preview.cs files. The floating, falling, and preview platform types
	serve as the decorators to the basic platform. The three classes all inherit from
	the BaseDecorator class which will be expanded as needed. The three classes 	encapsulate the basic Platform class which stores general position and size
	information about any type of platform.  
#DYNAMIC_INHERITANCE
	figuring this part out still. will either be something with how the platforms handle 	collisions separately, or how they delete themselves given time. maybe something else.
